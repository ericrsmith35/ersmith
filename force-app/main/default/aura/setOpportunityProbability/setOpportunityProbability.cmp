<!-- 
To be used as a quick action, a Lightning component needs to meet certain conditions. It needs to be configured as able to be executed as an action. It also needs to know the context of the page that it’s executed from. And, since you’re modifying data and want to save the changes, you need an Apex class to help with the work.

For the component to know its page context, it must implement the "force:hasRecordId" interface. 
This interface helps save the record ID, so you can make changes to the record.

For the component to be used as a quick action, it must also implement the  "force:lightningQuickActionWithoutHeader" interface.
